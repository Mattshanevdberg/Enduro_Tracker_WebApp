NOTES on GET function:
What is GET '/" requests? What does this look like on the client side? Is this the url they are typing in? if it was "/test" would the url be website/test?
A GET is the default HTTP verb a browser uses when you type a URL or click a link. Each route is just the path part of that URL:
@app.route("/") handles GET /, i.e., https://example.com/. When a user types that into the address bar, the browser sends a GET request to /, and your root() handler responds.
If you changed it to @app.route("/test"), then the handler would run for https://example.com/test—that’s the path the client would request. Everything before the path (scheme, host, port) depends on how the app is deployed.
So yes, the path you register determines the trailing part of the URL clients use. On the client side they might navigate there directly, or app code (fetch, axios, etc.) could make a GET request to that URL.

Correct. Importing a Python module executes its top-level code once, so any statements at module scope—like a print()—run immediately during the import. After that first import, the module is cached in sys.modules; later imports just reuse it, so the top-level code (and prints) won’t rerun unless you reload the module.
